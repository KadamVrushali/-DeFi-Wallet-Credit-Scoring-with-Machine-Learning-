# -DeFi-Wallet-Credit-Scoring-with-Machine-Learning-
This project builds a credit scoring system for DeFi wallets using transaction-level data from the Aave V2 protocol. We extract key wallet-level features, handle missing values, engineer insights, and train multiple classification models â€” all to predict a wallet's creditworthiness.
